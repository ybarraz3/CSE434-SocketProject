This directory/folder contains three files.  The first two,

1. UDPEchoClient.c
2. UDPEchoServer.c

were demo'd in class on Thursday, 01/27/2022.  You may want to check out the video for the lecture
that day.  Test that you can compile and run the server and client on different machines and on the
same machine.

The third file is:

3. defns.h

It contains the definition of a simple structure.  I suggest you try to modify the client and 
server to:
(a) Each of the client and server #include this "defns.h" file.
(b) Have the client initialize the structure, and pass it to the server using sendto(), writing a number of bytes equal to the sizeof( struct Name-of-Struct ).
(c) Have the server read the structure from the socket using recvfrom(), print the fields in the
    structure and then modify the structure in some way, e.g., increment the integers.  Send the
    modified structure back to the client using sendto().
(d) Have the client read the structure from the socket using recvfrom(), print the fields in the
    modified structure; iterates ITERATIONS times.
